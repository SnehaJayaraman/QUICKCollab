# QUICKCollab
A student-faculty collaboration portal

University students need ongoing opportunities to collaborate with professors as well as other interested students for professional development in an era of rapid and continuous change. However, limited resources and lack of a platform/portal to facilitate such an interaction limits collaboration.

Our project aims to provide a common platform for students and professors to interact and collaborate for projects and research work that suit their area of interest.
This makes it easier and more convenient to approach the right people with appropriate domain specific knowledge. Thus ,this project will benefit our college students and professors as well.
